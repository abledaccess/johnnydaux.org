While there's little that is unique about my name offline, I try, however, to provide myself a noteworthy "voice" through various means online: [I blog about my life as a quadriplegic](https://abledaccess.com); [co-organize #a11yTO](http://a11yto.com); perform web accessibility assessments and manual keyboard centered user tests; [guest write](http://simplyaccessible.com/article/being-disabled-can-be-lame/); [code on Github (har!)](https://github.com/abledaccess/), <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@johnnydaux">jabber on Mastodon</a>.
