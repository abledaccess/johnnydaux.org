While there's little that is unique about my name offline, I try, however, to provide myself a noteworthy "voice" through various means online: [I blog about how my life as a quadriplegic is affected by technology](https://abledaccess.com); [co-organize #a11yTO](http://a11yto.com); perform web accessibility assessments and manual keyboard centered user tests; [fart around on Github](https://github.com/abledaccess/) and <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@johnnydaux">toot on Mastodon</a>.
