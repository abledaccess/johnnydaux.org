"My name is Johnny, I'm just one of many. But I’m also a disabled web worker and, as evidenced by my continued existence, a stubbornly thriving, plant powered antifascist!"

## About this project

The "daux" in "johnnydaux" is meant to be pronounced "doe". On the [actual site](https://johnnydaux.org) I explain how my name, Johnny, isn't all that unique and, thus, the domain is meant to be a play on "John Doe" – a moniker secondarily used to reference the "[everyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman)".

With that said, and much more to the point, this project represents a landing hub linking to my most significant online exploits and activities. Plus this project serves as a spot to try out some techniques. Namely my use of [Viewport-percentage lengths](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#viewport-relative-lengths), in the form ‘vmin’ units. Meaning the text of the page will grow and shrink as you move both the width and height of your browser window proportionally.

Please check and [try the result out at johnnydaux.org](https://johnnydaux.org).
